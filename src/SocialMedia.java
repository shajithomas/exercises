/*
You are in charge of designing a small, in-memory social network, with the basic functionality of adding friendship
between two people via an AddFriendship function, and a GetSuggestedFriends function for a particular user in the
network. The criteria is to pick someone with whom the given user has the most number of friends in common.
Start by discussing the most suitable data structure, and implement all the objects and functions.

AddFreindShip(Person a, Person b) : This will add connection between two in the network

List<Person> GetSuggestedFriends(Person a) : This will check with everyone and will return the list of people with most common friends
